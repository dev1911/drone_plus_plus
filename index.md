<h1>Drone++</h1>

Drone-based logistics is a very hot topic in research and has the potential to change the future of logistics and e-commerce. The project focuses on providing an interface through which a logistics operator can track the drones in motion. The proposed system is a Web App through which customers can place orders. Once an order is placed, the route planning algorithm will select a drone to service the needs based on factors like distance, battery level left, nearest charging station, etc.

## Features:
1. Real-time tracking of drones.
2. Placing an order to be serviced by drones.
